A: A .git folder/file is created that stores the metadata about the file you have. You need to do it for you to be able to begin taking snapshots of your project files.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area seems to be a purgatory where you can make changes to multiple files at once without altering files in the working directory or making a commit. It could be a low risk area to alter multiple files at once and prepare them before going through with any official changes. It should help you keep your commit orderly.

Q: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
A: Diagrams help you the parent-child relationship between commits. You can see which commits are related to each other and reachable depending on the branch.

Q: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
A: Merging combines the insertions and deletions from the branch tips and traces back to the shared ancestor to determine that. The old branch tips are both parents of the new master tip. The diagram represents this and we can use it see all the commits that are reachable from the new tip.

Q: What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
