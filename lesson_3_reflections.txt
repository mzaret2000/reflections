Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When your working with multiple people. When you're working with multiple machines. You may also want a backup in case your local machine crashes.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: You may prefer to have a different version of the reposoitory on your local machine. You may be experimenting and purposely differ from the github repo.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Forks are special cloning mechanism available on github that allows your clone to be related to the original project but keeps your project separate from the original.
Branches are different versions of the same project versus a clone which is a copy of a project. Forks are only for github. You'll still need to clonen after you fork to bring a repo to your home machine.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: So you can understand how anything you build fits in with the current state of the project. 
Is what you're doing easily compatible with the remote master or are you diverging significantly.
